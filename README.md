Bienvenidos.  I'm Zac.  I apply software development principles and basic coding to manage civil engineering projects.  My team consists of civil and electrical engineers, business intelligence developers, power distribution designers, and project controllers.  We call ourselves the **_Crosscut Crew_** because of the diverse disciplines represented in the team.

The Crosscut Crew applies a loose _agile framework_ to our workflow and we make it a point to have fun along the way.

_If you can't have fun, then stay home_.  
-- Rudy R. of the Crosscut Crew
